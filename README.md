## Hi there 👋

I am a third-year undergraduate student at Elon University enrolled in the 3+1 Accelerated Dual Degree Business program, class of 2027. I will be receiving a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration - Finance and a Master of Science in Business Analytics.

I am proficient in Microsoft Applications (Excel, Word, Powerpoint), Bloomberg Market Concepts, as well as Bloomberg Environmental Social Governance. I am analytically driven, and have experience with Python and Tableau. 

I am currently working on preparing and publishing Undergraduate Research. My research is determining the correlation of how poitical uncertainty affects stock markets within different sectors in the International and Domestic markets. 

During this summer, I will be participating in a Chief Operating Office Operations internship with Wells Fargo in Charlotte, NC.
